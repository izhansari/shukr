// some might be middle and perfect. some might be perfect middle and closing (in window). This is the real goal and the metric
// that matters most for people." It decides which days keep the streak and count as met (Journey's green days, its rate, the
// runs) — never a prayer's score or grade. Flipping it recounts history at the new bar (nothing stored: "i want it to be
// something the user can easily change and flip between"); the fresh start (FreshStart.swift) is where every count begins.
